# Emacs Config

My Emacs config. Mostly for Go dev.

### Installation

`git clone` the repo into your `.emacs.d` folder. From there, opening Emacs should download any repos from Mela (or other package managers), and you should be good to go.

### Usage

This setup uses [Graphene](https://github.com/rdallasgray/graphene), so see that repo for documentation surrounding keyboard shortcuts.
